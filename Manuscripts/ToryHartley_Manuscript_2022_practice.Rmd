# Abstract

This is a practice assignment by Tory Hartley-Cox for the course Productivity and Reproducibility in Ecology and Evolution. All documents, folders and data presented are to demonstrate procedures and skills learned during the completion of class work and assignments. This is not meant to be a complete and finished manuscript for a real research project.

# Introduction

To demonstrate the ability to add an in-text citation to a manuscript in R markdown, I have copied the first paragraph of my introduction from my Master's research proposal. The in-text citation is not correct; it is to demonstrate.

Since European colonization, the Canadian prairies have undergone three distinct waves of significant environmental changes. (1) Hunting and trapping removed large mammals, such as the Plains Bison (Bison bison bison) and the Plains wolf (Canis lupus nubilus), altering the complex patchwork of grassland habitat formed and maintained through grazing patterns[@alexandrino2019]. (2) The Federal government leased large areas of prairie for cattle grazing, further altering the grassland habitat due to critical differences in grazing patterns and intensities between domestic cattle (Bos taurus) and bison[@alexandrinoLargeTerrestrialBird2019; @alexandrino2019]. (3) An influx of land conversion for agriculture resulted in losing 80% of the historic 110,000km 2 of Canadian prairies by the 1990s[@guidenPredatorPreyInteractions2019]. Land conversion for agriculture has significantly slowed within the past two decades, but other land-use practices (e.g., Oil and natural gas extraction and urbanization) have increased in the region, further altering the Canadian Prairies[@guidenPredatorPreyInteractions2019; @flemingNovelPredationOpportunities2018; @alexandrino2019].

# Methods

First paragraph taken from research proposal, for example purposes.

Owl Monitoring: Beginning in February 2022, I will use standardized roadside nest surveys to revisit known historic owl nesting sites and find new nesting locations. Fourteen adult male owls will be trapped and fitted with a satellite transmitter (35g transmitters; Vertebrate Systems Ltd.) attached using a Teflon backpack-style harness. Adult males are targeted because females are more closely associated with the nest during the incubation and early chick-rearing stages of breeding, and capturing females early in the nesting season poses a risk of nest abandonment. Using standardized raptor capture protocols, owls will be trapped using Bow-net, Dho Gaza trap, and Bal-Chatri traps. Standard measurements will be taken, and owls will be banded with a U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife numbered aluminum leg band.

# Results

My project does not have results yet.

# Discussion

First paragraph taken from research proposal, for example purposes.

The remaining large tracts of Canadian mixed-grass prairies are predominantly within protected conservation areas (e.g., Grassland National Park), provincial and federal crown land, and private land, but despite a large proportion of grasslands being protected, the mixed-grass prairies are the second most fragmented grassland ecoregion in Canada (Atkinson. 2009; Roch &amp; Jaeger, 2014).  Historically Saskatchewan had the largest proportion of Canadian prairie, but only 9% of the province's prairie is protected today. The South of the Divide (SoD) is a 14,157 km 2 conservation management area in the mixed-grass prairie region in the Southwestern corner of Saskatchewan; formed to implement a multi- strategy protection plan for nine federally listed species at risk of extinction and their habitat (Environment and Climate Change Canada.  2017).  The South of the Divide action plan identifies several common continuing threats to species-at-risk in the mixed-grass prairies as a whole, including increased predation pressure, likely as a result of the conversion of native habitat to cropland, grazing and industrial infrastructure, alterations to grazing and fire regimes, and changes in plant communities (Environment and Climate Change Canada. 2017). Studies within the Canadian prairies have examined how anthropogenic changes to the environment have negatively affected species-at-risk, but few have assessed factors that contribute to the increasing success of the few predator species that benefit from these changes.

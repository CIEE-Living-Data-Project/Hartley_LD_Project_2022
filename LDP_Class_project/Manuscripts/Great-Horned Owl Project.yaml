    Abstract: Wildlife living within urban ecosystems have to adapt or perish.
    Red-legged Seriema, a large

    terrestrial bird, are rare in urban ecosystems, however, they have been
    reported in a medium-sized

    Brazilian city. We investigated the reasons for this occurrence as well as
    their behavior. We assessed

    the distribution of Seriemas (including fledglings), free-ranging cats, and
    cat-feeding points provided

    by humans, and past records of Seriemas in the study area. We discovered
    that Seriemas are sharing

    spatial resources with cats without apparent conflicts, and intraspecific
    competition was important

    to define the spatial distribution of Seriemas. This species is able to use
    human-made structures to

    improve territory defense and opportunistic foraging. Direct and indirect
    human food provisioning

    is helping them to survive in the studied area, but is also facilitating the
    domestication process,

    which may cause future conflicts with humans and cats. Although Seriemas
    have inhabited the

    studied urban area for years, they are still adapting their behaviors for
    urban life, as they have not yet

    perceived the dangers of automotive traffic. Our study corroborates that
    wild species may adapt to

    urban areas driven by human contact, but it also acts as a trap for the
    adaptive process.

    Novel ecosystems (‘emerging ecosystems’) result when species occur in
    combinations and relative

    abundances that have not occurred previously within a given biome, due to
    deliberate or inadvertent

    human agency. Humans have changed the environment through disturbance,
    physical structures or

    additional resources. Many vertebrate predators inhabit cities, towns and
    other places that humans have built or altered, and make use of these
    anthropogenic niches. These predators range in size from bats swarming
    around lamp posts, to leopards stalking domestic animals in the heart of
    cities. In this essay, we describe four scenarios where predators
    opportunistically make use of anthropogenic niches. First, humans are
    surrounded by animals, including synanthropic rodents and birds, livestock
    and pets, that can be novel prey for opportunistic predators. Second,
    feeding on prey concentrations created through anthropogenic niches
    increases their hunting efficiency, by reducing both search and commute
    times. Third, anthropogenic environments create novel situations such as
    thermals and artificial lighting that advantage some predators, increasing
    their capture success. Finally, many predators have developed novel hunting
    strategies to make the most of opportunities in anthropogenic environments
    that can lead to greater hunting success. We give examples of these four
    scenarios and have developed a conceptual model that captures the common
    mechanisms relevant to each, with predictions for how these can be explored
    further in future studies. Predators exploiting anthropogenic niches can
    experience greater ease of hunting, decreased search effort and/or increased
    capture success. Consequently, these animals experience many physiological
    and reproductive benefits over conspecifics that do not make similar use of
    anthropogenic niches, ultimately benefitting from living alongside humans

    Ecological novelty, when conditions deviate from a historical baseline, is
    increasingly common as humans modify habitats and communities across the
    globe. Our ability to anticipate how novelty changes predator–prey inter
    actions will likely hinge upon the explicit evaluation of multiple forms of
    novelty, rather than a focus on single forms of novelty (e.g., invasive
    predators or climate change). We provide a framework to assess how multiple
    forms of novelty can act, alone or in concert, on components shared by all
    predator–prey interactions (the predation sequence). Considering how novelty
    acts throughout the predation sequence could improve our understanding of
    predator–prey interactions in an increasingly novel world, identify
    important knowledge gaps, and guide conservation decisions in the
    Anthropocene.

    artificial nightlight is increasingly recognized as an important
    environmental disturbance that influences the habitats and fitness of
    numerous species. However, its effects 

    on wide-ranging vertebrates and their interactions remain unclear. Light
    pollution has the potential to amplify land-use change, and as such,
    answering the question of how 

    this sensory stimulant affects behavior and habitat use of species valued
    for their eco logical roles and economic impacts is critical for
    conservation and land-use planning.  Here, we combined satellite-derived
    estimates of light pollution, with GPS-data from cougars Puma concolor
    (n=56), mule deer Odocoileus hemionus (n=263) and locations of cougar-killed
    deer (n=1562 carcasses), to assess the effects of light exposure on 

    mammal behavior and predator–prey relationships across wildland–urban
    gradients in 

    the southwestern United States. Our results indicate that deer used the
    anthropogenic environments to access forage and were more active at night
    than their wildland con specifics. Despite higher nightlight levels, cougars
    killed deer at the wildland–urban 

    interface, but hunted them in the relatively darkest locations. Light had
    the greatest effect of all covariates on where cougars killed deer at the
    wildland–urban interface. Both species exhibited functional responses to
    light pollution at fine scales; individ ual cougars and deer with less light
    exposure increasingly avoided illuminated areas 

    when exposed to greater radiance, whereas deer living in the wildland–urban
    interface selected elevated light levels. We conclude that integrating
    estimates of light pollution into ecological studies provides crucial
    insights into how the dynamic human footprint 

    can alter animal behavior and ecosystem function across spatial scales.
